as words numbers and graphics monitors

187
00:10:42,084 --> 00:10:50,133
are of two types cathode ray tube CRT

and flat panel displays a printer takes

189
00:10:51,033 --> 00:10:56,082
a processed data from the computer

190
00:10:53,007 --> 00:10:59,082
called soft copy and generates a hard

191
00:10:56,082 --> 00:11:01,160
copy of the same soft copy is an image

192
00:11:00,045 --> 00:11:04,122
or text file viewed on a computer

whereas<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hard copy is a printed</font>

194
00:11:05,022 --> 00:11:11,070
version of the same there are three

types of printers ink jet printer laser

similar to speakers except<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they are</font>

allows the display to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> visible to many</font>

210
00:11:59,025 --> 00:12:06,081
people so far we have learnt about

211
00:12:03,012 --> 00:12:09,108
various input processing and output

212
00:12:06,081 --> 00:12:11,086
devices let's now take part in this fun

213
00:12:10,008 --> 00:12:15,011
activity

215
00:12:15,011 --> 00:12:20,075
data just like your brain helps you in

216
00:12:18,032 --> 00:12:23,114
keeping lots of important things in mind

217
00:12:20,075 --> 00:12:27,080
so a computer store data in what is

218
00:12:24,014 --> 00:12:31,049
called a computer memory a computer has

219
00:12:27,008 --> 00:12:35,081
two types of memory primary or main

220
00:12:31,049 --> 00:12:39,092
memory and secondary memory the main of

221
00:12:36,053 --> 00:12:43,084
primary memory is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very fast it is called</font>

Ram the speed of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer depends on</font>

224
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:54,044
the RAM data and instructions are stored

processing speed the primary<font color="#CCCCCC"> memory is</font>

234
00:13:21,005 --> 00:13:29,012
limited so to store unlimited data we

235
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:32,036
use secondary memory any data or program

236
00:13:29,012 --> 00:13:35,054
that is kept in secondary memory has to

237
00:13:32,036 --> 00:13:37,121
be copied by<font color="#E5E5E5"> DRAM because the computer</font>

238
00:13:35,054 --> 00:13:40,142
cannot process data directly on

239
00:13:38,021 --> 00:13:44,065
secondary memory these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of the</font>

240
00:13:41,042 --> 00:13:49,094
devices which serve as secondary memory

241
00:13:44,065 --> 00:13:52,144
pendrive hard disc and DVD so how does

242
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:55,100
the computer stores data in its memory

243
00:13:53,044 --> 00:14:01,091
computer stores all information<font color="#CCCCCC"> in just</font>

244

<font color="#E5E5E5">two digits 0</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> & 1</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a single binary digit</font>

245
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:09,154
that is a one or a zero is called a bit

246
00:14:06,029 --> 00:14:13,073
a group of<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight bits is called a bite</font>

247
00:14:10,054 --> 00:14:18,067
look at this table it shows the

relationship between bits and bytes
