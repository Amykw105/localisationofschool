## Problem

 - Students in schools want to know aboout Computer - Internet but they don't know how to use it in right way because teachers also don't know how to operate computer
 
 - Our Mozilla volunteers make campaign like kidzilla, Women in web literacy but It require more time of them. They can not give more time from their personal time. It is not sustainable way of development neither for students nore for volunteers.
 
## Solution 

We are bridge between newbies on Internet and remote volunteers/who donâ€™t have time to go and teach them periodically. :star2:

- By delivering Video series to schools in localised language and make teacher understand how to use it.

- Video will be based on school syllabus. here<link> is list of topics on which we are making videos.

- Intially Volunteer will visit school and give demo of some video :running:. They will explain to teachers that How can they use this video and learn by yourself as well to teach students. If they are interested then these videos will be handover to school faculties.:school:


## Development

We need poeple who are social activist, willing to give back something to society in any form. 

We are looking for volunteers who has beginner level of skills in multimedia.
